    "body": "What I am looking at is mapping the CDDL to my source code. Choices can currently be expressed in different forms with different syntax.\r\nAnd it looks to me CDDL is more orienting towards CBOR validation rather than CBOR description. Am I right? Is it intented?\r\n\r\nHere are examples from the current CDDL specification:\r\n```\r\nattire = \"bow tie\" / \"necktie\" / \"Internet attire\"\r\nprotocol = 6 / 17\r\ndelivery = (\r\n\tstreet: tstr, ? number: uint, city //\r\n\tpo-box: uint, city //\r\n\tper-pickup: true\r\n)\r\n\r\nattire /= \"swimwear\"\r\n\r\ndelivery //= (\r\n\tlat: float, long: float, drone-type: tstr\r\n)\r\n\r\nbasecolors = (\r\n                black: 0, red: 1,  green: 2,  yellow: 3,\r\n                blue: 4,  magenta: 5,  cyan: 6,  white: 7,\r\n              )\r\nextended-color = &(\r\n                basecolors,\r\n                orange: 8,  pink: 9,  purple: 10,  brown: 11,\r\n              )\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo clean it, first I will remove the choice define as a group (used by `basecolors` in the examples). [The CDDL spec defines `groups` in the context of `map` or `array`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cbor-cddl-00#section-2.1). While the example `basecolors` would not have a sense at all in the context of `map` or `array`. If you want to keep the syntax, we could use `=&(...)` to always define \"complex\" choice.\r\n\r\nWhile the example `attire` and `protocol` are only defined for CBOR data validation, the other examples are more used to structure CBOR data.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to redefine the \"choice\" definition and have only two types of choices:\r\n- **the (validation) choice** mainly uses for CBOR data validation. The syntax `choice1 / choice2 / ...` could be kept\r\n- **the named choice** mainly uses for CBOR data representation. The named choice would cover all other choices and would require an annoted name for each entry. The name would not be used in the CBOR representation. The syntax `|name1: choice1 | name2: choice2 | ... |` could be used to represent named choice (`|` is often used to represent `or` operation in programming language).\r\n\r\nSo the examples above would be converted into:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndelivery = | full-address: ( street: tstr, ? number: uint, city)\r\n           | po-address: (po-box: uint, city)\r\n           | pickup: per-pickup: true\r\n\r\ndelivery =| coordonate: (lat: float, long: float, drone-type: tstr)\r\n\r\n\r\nbasecolors =| black: 0 | red: 1 |  green: 2 |  yellow: 3 | blue: 4 |  magenta: 5 |  cyan: 6 |  white: 7\r\nextended-color =| basecolors | orange: 8 | pink: 9 | purple: 10 | brown: 11\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this syntax I would easily link these definitions to my source code. For instance in C, I would have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum basecolors { BLACK = 0, RED = 1, GREEN = 2, ...}\r\nenum extended_color { BLACK = 0, RED = 1, GREEN = 2, ..., ORANGE = 8, ...}\r\nstruct delivery {\r\n\tenum { FULL_ADDRESS, PO_ADDRESS, PICKUP, DRONE } type;\r\n\tunion {\r\n\t\tstruct { char* street; int number, char* city; } full_address;\r\n\t\tstruct { int po_box; char* city; } po_address;\r\n\t\tstruct { bool per_pickup } pickup;\r\n\t\tstruct { float lat; float long; char* drone_type; } drone;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the current CDDL syntax, it is impossible to link group choice to source code. And it makes hard to maintain the changes."

For people with a JavaScript background, perhaps describing _table_ as being like a `Map` (rather than `Object`) would help.   \r\n\r\nIn the YAML [specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759963) and related [map tag definition](http://yaml.org/type/map.html), the word `mapping` is used for the representation style with name-value pairs, while `map` is used for what I think you are calling `_table_`.

    "body": "Today, the spec is written for CBOR, and just implies that CDDL can also be used with JSON.\r\nSince that is [happening](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8007#appendix-A), add an appendix that makes the information explicit which parts of CDDL remain unused with JSON.\r\n\r\nInitial attempt of a list:\r\n\r\n* CBOR tags\r\n* byte-string constants (h'beef' etc.)\r\n* prelude elements that based on major types #2 and #6 (bstr/bytes, all the tags from tdate to cbor-any)\r\n\r\nWhen mapping the JSON data model (which is not distinguishing integer from floating-point numbers) to that of CBOR, numbers with a zero fractional part become integers.  Details of this may also need some additional information.  Probably also point to I-JSON (RFC7493)."
